# slack-bolt-starter
A starter to get started with slack bolt library! This code listens for messages containing the word "hello" and responds with a greeting that mentions the user who sent the message. You'll need to set the `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` environment variables before running this code.
